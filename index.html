      <h1>Why coding</h1>
      <p>The world is advancing at a super-fast rate and most of these advancements are tech-based in one way or the other. This is why I see coding as a key component in the future and anyone who will not know some programming will be highly disadvantaged. Furthermore, coding is fun ad it lets you be as creative as you can be.</p>
