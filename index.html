    <div class="About">
      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>I am Nathan Ng'ethe, a student at Moringa School learning how to make his first lines of code. I completed high school lat year from Alliance High School and came out with a reasonable grade. I come from Nyeri where my parents in the farming industry. I have one brother who is currently in high school. I hope join the University of Nairobi and hopefully find my niche in life.</p>

    <div class="Coding">
      <h1>Why coding</h1>
      <p>The world is advancing at a super-fast rate and most of these advancements are tech-based in one way or the other. This is why I see coding as a key component in the future and anyone who will not know some programming will be highly disadvantaged. Furthermore, coding is fun and it lets you be as creative as you can be.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Job">
      <p>Currently, I have no job experience and that is why I joined Moringa so that I can get some experience on how the job environment feels like. However, I hope that I can get some job experience at the end of the program and get to learn how to run a company.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Future">
      <h1>The future</h1>
      <p>I plan to complete the Moringa coding course and have the ability to build my own app and devices as well. In core I plan to do Java and learn C++ and arduino on the way. My goal is to get a chance to be featured amongst the top 30 under 30 and hopefully get to be among the top ten richest people on earth.</p>
